This project parses NOTAMs and related maritime safety notices to extract rocket launch areas, debris zones, and restricted zones, then visualizes them on a map. It also includes historical archive matching, source reconciliation, image export, coordinate lookup, and distance measurement features.<br>

## Project Overview

NOTAMs (Notice to Airmen) are aviation notices that warn pilots about temporary hazards, including restricted areas, debris zones, and other flight limitations. For rocket launch missions, these notices often contain the area boundary, effective time, notice number, and supporting remarks, making them an important source for identifying launch activity and hazard zones. The project parses these notices into structured coordinates and combines them with time windows and source metadata for unified display.

The current pipeline covers three main data sources: NOTAM notices, NGA MSI maritime safety information, and archived match results. These sources do not share a single consistent text format, so the parser handles coordinate extraction, time normalization, area filtering, and deduplication before writing the final results to the map and local data files.

## Typical Format

Rocket-launch-related NOTAMs often look like this:<br>

> A1690/23 - A TEMPORARY DANGER AREA ESTABLISHED BOUNDED BY: N392852E0955438-N385637E0955854-N390118E0970056-N393335E0965708 BACK TO START. VERTICAL LIMITS:SFC-UNL. SFC - UNL, 06 JUL 03:18 2023 UNTIL 06 JUL 04:45 2023. CREATED: 05 JUL 07:40 2023

In this example, “A1690/23” is the NOTAM serial number, the sequence of coordinates defines the hazard area, and “06 JUL 03:18 2023 UNTIL 06 JUL 04:45 2023” is the effective time window. The wording may vary across countries and sea areas, but the core information usually remains the same: notice ID, time range, and coordinate boundaries.

## Usage

After startup, the project automatically fetches data, generates structured results, and renders them on the map. The map focuses on information needed for current visibility and analysis rather than preserving every original notice in full. When the same event appears from multiple sources, the system keeps the most complete and interpretable fields and tries to avoid being overwritten by empty or default values.

### Data-source selection

Select providers in `config.ini`. FAA remains the default:

```ini
[DATA_SOURCES]
enabled = faa
```

Use `enabled = daip` for DAIP, or `enabled = faa, daip` to aggregate both in priority order. Duplicate records with the same `SOURCE + CODE` keep the version from the first configured provider. `[ICAO] codes` supplies the shared location list.

Available providers are `faa`, `daip`, `dins` (legacy adapter), and `msi` (legacy adapter). Provider-specific request and parsing code lives under `fetch/sources/<provider>/`. Every provider emits the same normalized fields, while `main.py` only performs aggregation, filtering, classification, and persistence.

The DAIP certificate chain is commonly absent from Python/Certifi's default trust store, so the sample configuration uses `verify_ssl = false`. Set it to `true` when the corresponding CA certificates are installed in the runtime environment.
